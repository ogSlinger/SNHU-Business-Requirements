## SNHU-Requirements-Collecting

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  For this project, the client was a company called "DriverPass". They noticed that there was little tools to train students to pass their driving tests. The product was a system involving a cloud-based backend where people could sign up, take practical/written tests, and see their progress.
  
What did you do particularly well?

  For this project, I feel I understood some nuances better with some web development components. I felt I could identify a lot of the core requirements not too difficult.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I would probably want to further investigate into cloud computing, as it was one of the requirements from the client. My knowledge of cloud-based systems and their integration to projects is a little shallow, and I would like to know more when developing them. That way I could identify more refined requirements for cloud-based systems.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  I interpreted the user's needs through the different lenses of the actors in the system. By thinking of what the user may need in relations to the other actors of the system, one could flesh out a lot of the system requirements.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  My approach to designing software is mainly rooted in empathy. When you look through the perspective of what the user may need to use via abstractions of the system allowed me to list out a lot of it's requirements. The breakdown of requirements in a system design document definitely helps structure the many ways the system needs to work, and the components it needs. I will probably utilize the projects as a means of reminding myself what all goes into system design, and perhaps may utilize it in future works.
