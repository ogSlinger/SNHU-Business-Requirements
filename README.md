## SNHU-Requirements-Collecting

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  For this project, the client was a company called "DriverPass". They noticed that there was little tools to train students to pass their driving tests. The product was a system involving a cloud-based backend where people could sign up, take practical/written tests, and see their progress.
  
What did you do particularly well?

  For this project, I feel I understood some nuances better with some web development components. I felt I could identify a lot of the core requirements not too difficult.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I would probably want to further investigate into cloud computing, as it was one of the requirements from the client. My knowledge of cloud-based systems and their integration to projects is a little shallow, and I would like to know more when developing them. That way I could identify more refined requirements for cloud-based systems.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
